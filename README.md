# Hey there! I'm Sahar Omer 👋

## Who Am I?

I’m a **tech enthusiast** with a passion for **learning and exploring** the endless
possibilities of technology. Whether it’s writing code or brainstorming innovative
ideas, I’m here for the journey—and the growth that comes with it.

## What I’m Building

Right now, I’m crafting a portfolio that showcases my work and **expanding my knowledge**.
My pride and joy? A **Weather App** built with React 🌤️—because who doesn’t love
knowing if it’s sweater weather?

## What I Value

I’m all about **mutual respect** and **collaboration**. Whether it’s debugging
code or tackling big ideas, I believe great things happen when we work together.

## Fun Facts

- I love sitcoms (cue *The Big Bang Theory* and *Community*) and cats 🐾.
If these two spark joy in your life too, we’re destined to be friends!
